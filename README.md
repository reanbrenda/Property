## **Mtaa**
Mtaa is a real estate app designed and coded with ❤ by _group 14 members_.

## What does Mtaa do?
  It bridges the _gap between_ real estate and _property owners_ and _potential customers_.

## How does Mtaa do this?
  It provides a _platform_ for property owners to post their property which can then be viewed by prospective customers
   thereby _eliminating_ the advertising _cost_ to the property owners and reduces the _time_ taken for customers to look for
   property.
